# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked Skillcrush Accelerate Repo. Created a local dev environment to edit the wordpress site by making use of a new child theme.

**Thoughts:** Finally started to understand what child themes are for.  Important to follow a certain order of steps when recreating a PRD site as a local DEV site as I screwed up the order and then blanked out for about an hour on how to fix it.  After I snapped to, I dropped all tables in the DB and let Wordpress install scripts create the DB tables thus adding the tables I was missing and then imported the DB backup. Fell asleep at the keyboard before logging my progress.

### Day 2: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on wordpress child theme, using $wp_query parameters to customize what is displayed

### Day 3: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about register_post_type to create a custom post type.  I was then able to use my custom post type to create a custom page styled to my pseudo client's specifications.  Then moved on to custom fields by installing ACF.

**Thoughts:  I was in a big of hell for about an hour after installing ACF and adding the group fields, after editing the page I created with my custom post type, then adding the custom fields and refreshed, I was picking a php template file from the parent theme! Not sure how Wordpress knew to do that, that's a lesson for another day I guess.  After troubleshooting for an hour and pulling my hair out, a simple refresh of those pesky permalinks solved the problem.  Even though I had never changed the permalink and had been working in that custom post all along, for some reason the refresh that I did after adding the custom fields seemed to break the permalink.  My browser kept saying 'Page Not Found', but was displaying a page, just not the one I was expecting!

### Day 4: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress** Continue working with ACF.  Need to get my custom fields to display on my custom post type!

### Day 5: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress** Not sure it's progress, but updating my Git repos and staging deployments.  Must remember to push often!

**Thoughts:** I missed a day, graduate classes started yesterday and spent my day tracking down books and doing other work related tasks.  Only getting in about an hour or 2 day of coding, but I think if I can dedicate that much time at least, I should still be good, my 100 days of code just may need to be extended longer to learn all that I want to learn. 

### Day 6: July 10, 2017

**Today's Thoughts** Today's not really Day 6, but I'm logging it as such.  I've been coding quite a bit between the last post and today but not logging it like I should. So I will pick up this challenge from this day forward.  I've been doing some type of coding work almost every day, whether it's googling or reading about code to learn more, practicing tutorials or working on sample projects for my portfolio.
